 * Hypergeometric probability distribution.</a>
 * <p>
 * This probability is the one used to compute odds in
 * many of the lotteries in the United States.  It is used when
 * you are picking from two sets in a mixed population. The
 * basic example is a bag filled with red and black chips. 5 red
 * chips and 4 black ones.  You are asked to choose 3 chips
 * without looking.  What is the chance you will pick exactly
 * two black chips.  If you look below you will see the construction
 * parameters.  The population size, N, is 4 + 5 = 9. The sample size,
 * n, is 3 since we are picking 3 chips.  The sample set we are interested
 * in is black chips which there are 3 of so r = 3.  And finally the
 * random variable, y, is 2, the number of black chips we want to choose out of
 * 3 pulls.  Chips are not replaced between pulls.
 * </p>
 * <code>
 * double probability = HyperGeometric.probability(9, 3, 3, 2)
 * </code>
 * <p>
 * To compute lottery odds lets assume the lottery in question has
 * 50 numbers and they choose 6 of them at random live on television.
 * So we know N = 50 and the sample size n=6. You have 6 numbers you paid
 * money for that you are interested in, these six numbers represent the
 * selected set r, r = 6.  Now for the grand payoff, getting all six numbers
 * you need all picked numbers to be in your selected set.  y = 6.  Often there
 * is a lesser payout for matching less than six numbers.
 * Finally you usually win your money back if you match two numbers so here
 * y = 2.  To find the chance of winning anything you would compute
 * P(y &gt;= 2) since usually matching one number has no payout and zero matches
 * is definitely not paying out.
 * </p>
 * <pre>
 * // Chance to win anything is when P(y &gt; 2)
 * HyperGeometric cumulative = new HyperGeometric(greaterThanOrEqual,50,6,6)
 * double result = cumulative.getResult(2);
 * // it's a 14.572% chance to win anything back
 *
 * // Here's a static approach that doesn't create a HyperGeometric object.
 * CumulativeOperation.greaterThanOrEqual
 *                    .apply(rv-&gt; HyperGeometric.probability(50,6,6, rv), 2);
