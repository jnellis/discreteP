/**

 * Poisson probability distribution.</a>
 * <p>
 * Use when you have events that can happen instantaneously
 * and at any time. The chance of two or more events happening
 * at the same time is effectively zero for a time span small
 * enough.
 * <p>
 * For example: Over the years, a certain street corner has noted an
 * average of 7 traffic accidents per month.  What is the probability that
 * there will be double the amount of accidents the following month.  Here our
 * lambda is 7, the average from which we base the likelihood
 * of traffic accidents happening in a month. The random variable is 14, double
 * the amount of accidents expected.
 * <pre>
 * double result = Poisson.probability(7,14);  // less than 1% chance.
 * </pre>
 * <p>
 * What is the chance there will be 3 or less accidents next month?
 * <pre>
 * double result = new Poisson(lessThanOrEqual, 7).getResult(3) // 8.2% chance
 * // or by not creating a Poisson object, using static methods
 * result = CumulativeOperation.lessThanOrEqual
 *                             .apply(3, y-&gt; Poisson.probability(7,y));
