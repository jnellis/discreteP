/**
 * The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binomial_distribution">
 * Binomial probability distribution.</a>
 * <p>
 * Use when you need to ask the question,
 * "If the chance of something happening is P percent,
 * what is the probability it will happen Y times out of
 * N attempts."
 * Example: Die rolling. If the chance to roll a one is
 * 1/6 or 16.7%, what is the probability it will happen 3 times
 * out of 5 rolls.
 * <p>
 * Notes: The event must be a discrete event like rolling a die,
 * flipping a coin, or pulling a card.  Events that consider an
 * average percentage that it will happen or if each trial in turn
 * affects the percentage that the event will happen are not
 * modeled by the binomial probability distribution but can give
 * meaningful estimates. ex: A veteran NBA basketball player has a free throw
 * percentage of 70%. What is the probability he makes his next two
 * free throw shots. His first shot would then change his free throw
 * percentage by a very small amount but if this fact is omitted the answer is
 * relatively the same.
 * </p>
 * <pre>
 * // roll 5 dice, what is probability exactly three of them are the same value.
 * double probability = Binomial.probability(5, 0.166666, 3);
 *
 * // roll 5 dice, what is probability 3 or more dice are all the same value.
 * // aka 3-of-a-kind, 4-of-a-kind or 5-of-a-kind.
 * Binomial pdf = new Binomial(greaterThanOrEqual, 5, 0.166666);
 * double result = pdf.getResult(3);
 *
 * // or from a static context that creates no Binomial object
 * result = CumulativeOperation.greaterThanOrEqual
 *                             .apply(3, y -&gt; Binomial.probability(5, 0
 *                             .166666, y));
